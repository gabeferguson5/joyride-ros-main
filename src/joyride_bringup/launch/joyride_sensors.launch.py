# Comments added 12/13/23 by Josephine Wade
# This file launches all sensors; will need to be modified when more sensors are added
# This file could also be reworked to have launch configurations to decide which sensors could be launched but for now each section can be commented out or brought back in
# Requires:
#   - Sensors to be plugged in and configured (Lidar IP set and camera IPs set manually if IPs not automatically)
